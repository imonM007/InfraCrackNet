# InfraCrackNet
The repository is created for the paper "infraCrackNet: Automated Crack Detection in Infrastructure Using U-Net with Dataset Preparation, Manual Labeling, and Segmentation Performance" 

_There are basically 2 steps for this project._

**Step-1:** After collecting and labeling the files in makesense.ai, the saved files are need to be converted from JSON to JPG using "json_to_jpg.ipynb"

**Step-2:** Taking the JPG files then running it in U-Net deep learning model using "u_net_model.ipynb"

[N.B: The dataset files were uploaded to hugging face using "hugfaceCode.ipynb"]
